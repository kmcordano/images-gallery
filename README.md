Important Note:

This project was designed following the instructions in "Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with React and Python" by Bogdan Stashchuk
Published by Packt Publishing, accessed via O'Reilly Learning online

As such, much of the code is not original, and I do not claim ownership nor creativity of this project.
Rather, it provided me experience in many useful frameworks and utilities that are relevant to my career development.
